# Exercise: Component Hierarchies

Pick a website that you visit often (reddit, facebook, gmail etc.). Re-create the component hierarchy with at least 6 components (App, NavBar, NewList etc.). Do not worry about styles or content.

* [ ] App has at least 6 components
* [ ] At least 2 components are not at the top level (nested)
