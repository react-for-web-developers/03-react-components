# GitHub Component Hierarchy Example

This project demonstrates how to create a component hierarchy in React for CJ's class!

We will build an example `GitHub` barebones site with minimum styling to demonstrate how to utilize these components.

Component Hierarchy:

- NavBar
  - Search
  - Tabs
- Bio
- Repos
  - RepoList
- ContributionList
- Footer

## Exercise: Component Heirarchies

Pick a website that you visit often (reddit, facebook, gmail etc.). Re-create the component hierarchy with at least 6 components (App, NavBar, NewList etc.). Do not worry about styles or content.

- [x] App has at least 6 components
- [x] At least 2 components are not at the top level (nested)
